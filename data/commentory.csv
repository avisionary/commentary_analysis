It looked as if that would be how it finished until a controversial late penalty was awarded to Sevilla after a challenge by Guilavogui, who saw red for the incident. Whilst he did get to the ball first he was adjudged to have caught Lamela with the follow through and a spot-kick was awarded, which Rakitic duly converted by smashing it into the bottom-left corner.

They took the lead in the first half with an unfortunate own goal by Krivstov, and the hosts had shown signs of giving the Spanish side a competitive game. However, Ancelotti's men took control after the break, doubling their lead through the impressive Vinicius before the Brazilian extended the lead with his second goal of the game. A goal from Rodrygo and a late finish from Benzema capped off an excellent away performance.

Having not won a single point in this year's competition, it's been a really good showing from the home side in the first half and they can probably count themselves unlucky to not be going into half-time with a bigger lead. They took the lead on 22 minutes after Mazraoui handled in the box from a corner, with Ghezzal stepping up for the penalty. The Algerian winger's penalty was brilliant, giving Onana no chance as he sent it into the top right corner. Tadic nearly levelled straight away after a poor header in the Besiktas defence gave the Serbian forward the chance to shoot. Gunok did well though to be alert and charge down Tadic, smothering his dinked effort.

First, Carrasco was sent off for raising his hands at Otavio, and then the referee had to hand out multiple yellow cards to stop the protests. But it descended further when Wendell was sent off minutes later for Porto when he brushed off Cunha.

," When we finally get under way, today's final will be the ninth meeting between Liverpool and Real Madrid in the European Cup or Champions League.

," After days of speculation, Thiago and Konate start for Liverpool, after the former passed a late fitness test to feature. The latter is preferred to Matip as central defensive partner for Van Dijk, who was an unused substitute in the Reds' last two league games after coming off in the FA Cup final with a hamstring injury. Selected ahead of both Jota and Firmino, Diaz joins mainstays Salah and Mane up front.

," LaLiga champions Real Madrid are today targetting a record-extending 14th Champions League and European Cup success, and they rarely lose when reaching the final. On only three occasions out of 16 have Madrid failed to finish the job off when down to the final two - the most recent in 1981, when beaten by Liverpool in Paris. This season, Carlo Ancelotti's side have entertainingly eliminated holders Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City to reach this point - the latter thanks to a late Rodrygo double to force extra-time in the semi-final, before Karim Benzema then decided the tie with a penalty. Having cruised to the Spanish title with weeks to spare, Los Blancos managed only one win from their final four La Liga fixtures, but are now primed for the showpiece occasion.

," Seeking a seventh continental crown from 10 final appearances, Liverpool can move into joint second with Milan in the all-time list of champions by lifting the trophy today. The Reds would, though, still trail in the wake of their opponents, who ran out winners when the clubs last clashed in the final, four years ago in Kyiv. This year, the EFL and FA Cup winners have seen off Inter, Benfica and Villarreal en route to Paris, and a second-leg loss to the former back in March represents their last defeat anywhere. Though they narrowly missed out on being crowned Premier League champions, Jurgen Klopp's side have since enjoyed an 18-game unbeaten run - including 10 wins from their last 11.
