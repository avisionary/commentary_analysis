What a moment for Cole Palmer!!!! Sterling sets the youngster up on the edge of the box, and the 19-year-old slots the ball past Mignolet effortlessly to make it 4-0 to City!!! { Balanta, who has been run ragged in this match, and is repalced by 16-year-old Noah Mbamba-Muanda. { Rodri is replaced for City, by club captain Fernandinho. { It's not been a night to remember for N'Soki, and he's replaced by Brandon Mechele. { Straight after his first real chance of the night, De Ketelaere is replaced by Bas Dost. { GOOOALLLL!!!! Brugge have their goal at long last and it's Vanaken!!! He gets lucky as the ball deflects to him off several City defenders' legs, but the Brugge captain does very well to half-volley home a first time effort to make it 4-1!!! { Vormer has been quite impressive since he came on, and although his captain got lucky with the bounce of the ball, the substitute won't be complaining about his own contribution. { GOOOOALLLL!!! If the home fans were happy with their goal, they're not smiling any more. Fernandinho sends MAhrez through one-on-one, and the Algerian makes no mistake to make it 5-1 to City!!! { A great ball from Fernandinho to set up Mahrez, who extends his Champions League tally to three!

It's a brilliant cross into the box from the right wing by Milner, catching the Porto defence and keeper out, with Costa coming out to block the cross, but he completely misses the ball! It then falls to Mane at the far post, who had a simple tap-in from just a few yards out.

However, Costa decides to come out of his box and races up the pitch to try and clear it, but gets nowhere near the ball. Firmino then has an empty net to aim at and he slides the ball towards goal, which just has enough pace on it to beat Costa, who couldn't prevent it from crossing the line, despite sprinting back. { Jones with his third assist of the game! More lovely play by the midfielder, chipping the ball over the top for Firmino, but it's the huge mistake from Costa that leads to the goal. { GOAL! Firmino grabs his second and makes it 5-1!

Mbappe and Mendes link up down the left, and Mignolet doesn't deal at all well with the latter's cross. Mbappe, of course, is following up the ball, and he places it into the far corner to make it 1-0 to PSG!!! 70 seconds in, and PSG lead already! { The pass from Di Maria was picture-perfect, and it was exactly what Mbappe needed to volley that ball home with the ease that he did. Sublime skills from back to front by PSG. { GOOOOALLLL!!!! IT'S TWOOOOOO!!!!! PSG pass the ball around and through Brugge like they're invisible, and Di Maria dinks a lofted cross into the box. Mbappe's waiting, and he volleys a fantastic finish straight past Mignolet and into the back of the net! 2-0 up inside just seven minutes!!! { That touch from Mbappe and the pace to get past Hendry was just freakish, and if there's anyone to take up Messi's sizeable mantle in the next few years, it's most likely his free-scoring PSG team-mate. { GOOOOOOAALLLLLLLL!!!!!! THERE IT IS!!!!! It's number three for PSG, and it's Messi who gets his goal!!!! Mbappe speeds past Hendry at lightning pace on the left and finds Messi hurtling forward. He beats a few defenders, and fires a curling effort past Mignolet from the edge of the box!!! What a goal, and what a pair of footballers. { Mendes does come off, and on comes Kehrer to slot in at left-back. { Le Ketelaere collects a diagonal ball from Balanta, and does even better to get around Kehrer, who brings down the Brugge striker and is booked. { Sandra comes off in Brugge's first change, and replacing him is Ignace Van der Brempt. { N'Soki is fouled and wins a free-kick, which Lang takes before the referee's whistle. He's booked for that indiscretion, which is soft to say the least. { The assist from Lang was a good pass in itself, but the winger has been at the heart of everything good about Brugge's performance, particularly in this second half. { GOOOOALLLLL!!!!! Brugge have one back!!! Lang steams forward again under little pressure from PSG, and he carries the ball into the box. He tees up an unmarked Rits to his right, who places a lovely finish into the far corner and past Donnarumma! 3-1, and is the comeback on? { No sooner has Rits scored to get Brugge back into the game, he's then taken off! Ruud Vormer comes on in his place. { Balanta's industrious performance in midfield has also been good, as Noah Mbamba-Muanda comes on in his place. { Mbappe catches Mata very late and is rightfully booked.

Draxler does gain an assist for his troubles, though. { GOOOOALLLLLL!!!!! Guess who? PSG break away and have so much space. It's Mbappe tearing forward and despite having Draxler in support, the France forward wrong-foots Gulasci and smashes the ball into the bottom-left corner. He really is some player and it's 1-0 in favour of the Parisians. { The referee rightly judges that Orban's foul was both deliberate and cynical, and the Leipzig defender is booked. { Leipzig have looked far more threatening since PSG opened the scoring, and at the rate Angelino has been getting forward all game, it's no surprise that he was the one to provide that fantastic pass for Silva's equaliser. { GOOOOALLLLL!!!! Leipzig equalise, and it's fully deserved!!! Angelino advances down the left into the box, and smashes a teasing cross past the trailing PSG defenders into the path of Silva. The Portugal striker makes no mistake this time and smashes the ball beyond Navas and into the roof of the net! 1-1, and we have one hell of a game on our hands here in Paris!!! { Simakan is yellow carded after clattering through Mendes just outside his own box.

What a game this is turning out to be!!! { The horizontal movement across the pitch from Leipzig's midfielders is causing PSG all sorts of problems. It's no wonder Angelino is experiencing such freedom down the left given how many other forward runners that Hakimi is having to worry about, and the Spain left-back was on hand yet again to see another perfect cross directed goalwards! { PSG make their first change, as Georginio Wijnaldum is introduced in place of Herrera. { Gueye is also withdrawn, replaced by Danilo Pereira. { Haidara limps off for Leipzig having picked up a slight knock; Ilaix Moriba comes on in his place. { Moriba looks to break away with his first touch but is pulled back by Hakimi.

If there was a ball-shaped hole in the net, Sterling's effort would have found it. Ludicrously good from the City forward. { Bernardo adds an assist to his two goals for the night. { Zinchenko is now also on the pitch, with Stones making way. That now means Cancelo will move over to right-back! { Guardiola starts to look after his players, with Foden making way for Gundogan. { After losing his cool on the touchline, Matheus becomes the first player to be booked. The Sporting midfielder pulled Zinchenko to the floor before lashing out at Rodri. { Fernandinho replaces Rodri in midfield, and remarkably the latter is given a lecture from Guardiola as he makes his way to the bench. { Gundogan gets his name in the referee's book after a poorly-timed challenge. { Another substitution for the home side as Sarabia is replaced by Bruno Tabata. { Slimani will get 15 minutes to catch the eye, replacing Paulinho in the Sporting attack. { Esgaio is the latest player to be booked after a lunging challenge on Mahrez. { Amorim appears to be keeping it as tight as possible as defender Neto replaces Porro for the final seven minutes of normal time. { The referee shows Ugarte a card as he brings down Gundogan inside the centre circle. { Bernardo also makes way and is booed off the field, with Delap the one to replace him. { Guardiola continues to protect his first-team stars, as Ake replaces Laporte.

You can't blame the Villarreal keeper at this stage, he's been the busiest of any of his teammates by far in the second stanza. { GOOOALLL!!! That might just do it! Villarreal break at lightning speed through Alberto Moreno, he unselfishly feeds Gerard Moreno, who's shot is saved by Von Ballmoos before the substitute follows in to make it 3-1, and surely now, put this game to bed for Villarreal! { Opening goalscorer Pino comes off, and the birthday boy is replaced by Moises Gomez. { Felix Mambimbi comes on for Young Boys, in place of Fassnacht, who has impressed in this game. { Danjuma has been a stand-out for Villarreal, and is replaced by Samuel Chukwueze. { GOOOALLL!!! IT'S FOUR!!! Gerard Moreno finds himself in space on the edge of the box, and looks for the substitute Chukwueze who, with his first touch, dispatches the ball home to make it 4-1 and seal the game in Villarreal's favour! Young Boys have fought gallantly, but the away side are turning the screw now as we enter the last minutes. { Moreno has been his industrious but effective self in this match, and adds an assists to his tally, which of course already includes the second goal.

From the corner, Christensen gets the flick on at the near post, and Werner's there at the back post to tap into an empty net and make it 1-0!! Poor defending from the hosts, but what a way to begin this game for the visitors! { That header on from Christensen was sublime and made it so easy for Werner to tap the ball home, but crowding the Chelsea man at the near post didn't work out at all well for Zenit! { Hudson-Odoi catches Douglas late with no way of winning the ball, and the referee brandishes the first yellow card of the game in his direction. { GOOOOALLLL!!!! ZENIT EQUALISE!!!! They have a few passes into the Chelsea box which are dealt with, before Douglas crosses into the box from deep on the left. It's floating towards goal, but up pops Claudinho at the near post to head beyond Kepa and make it 1-1!!! It's been coming! { The cross from Douglas' deep position was very, very clever, and Claudinho's great late run has Zenit back on level terms! { That pass from Malcom was sublime, it confused Christensen and the Chelsea defence and left Azmoun with only a stranded Kepa to beat! { GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! ZENIT HAVE TURNED IT AROUND!!!! Malcom splits the Chelsea defence in two putting Azmoun through on goal, and he rounds Kepa before stroking the ball home to make it 2-1!!! What a comeback from the Russians!!! { Wendel can't continue, and Andrey Mostovoy comes on to replace him in the game's first change. { Lovren brings down Werner as he looks to turn on the edge of the box, and is yellow carded as Chelsea gain a free-kick from a dangerous position. { GOOOOALLLLL!!!! CHELSEA EQUALISE!!! It's a great passage of play from Chelsea as Werner and Barkley play a great one-two on the edge of the box. It comes back to Werner, who tees up Lukaku to tap into an empty net! We're back on level terms again at 2-2! { Lukaku looked like he might be offside, but that passing sequence from Werner and Barkley was just sublime and made it the easiest of finishes for the Chelsea striker. { Barkley, who played a big part in that equaliser, also comes off to be replaced by Hakim Ziyech. { Rakitskiy is withdrawn too for Zenit, and on comes Danil Krugovoy. { Off comes the booked Hudson-Odoi in Chelsea's first change, and he's replaced by Christian Pulisic. { Equalising goalscorer Lukaku also comes off after his crucial goal, and Kai Havertz comes on up front. { Off comes Saul for Chelsea, and Marcos Alonso enters the fray in his place. { The hobbling Azmoun comes off after not being able to recover from that clash with Sarr, and the hulking Artem Dzyuba comes onto the pitch. { Kuzyaev also comes off for Zenit, and on comes Magomed Ozdoev for him. { Malcom's had a very lively game, but it's ended by the introduction of Aleksandr Erokhin in his place. { That first touch from Pulisic to beat Barrios was fantastic play from the substitute, and after playing in Werner, gets the assist after the Germany striker's clinical finish! { GOOOALLLLL!!!! It's lovely play from Chelsea, and Pulisic plays in Werner inside the box. He's crowded, but he cuts inside Karavaev and smashes a low shot straight past Kerzhakov and into the back of the net, and it's 3-2!!! What a game!! { WHAT A GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!! Zenit equalise, again!!!! Dzyuba wins a long ball forward from Douglas and Chelsea don't deal with it, and from the ball back in from Claudinho, Sarr heads away before Ozdoev fires in a firecracker of a volley back towards goal and straight into the top corner!!! What a finish, and we're level again at 3-3!!!! "
https://www.goal.com/en/match/zenit-vs-juventus/eul6qgebtteqh8t8hjvafsftg,Zenit vs Juventus,Group Stage,1,0 - 1," The first yellow card of the game has been duly flourished - and it will be for Barrios, after he uncorked a challenge on Alex Sandro, scything low and missing the ball entirely. That could have been nastier. { The second half is only a few seconds old and already, Karavaev has been shown a yellow for a rash challenge on Chiesa. It's eager - too eager - and he pays the price for it. { Juventus make their first change now as Juan Cuadrado replaces Alex Sandro. { Juventus make their third change now as Arthur replaces Manuel Locatelli. { Juventus make their second change now as Dejan Kulusevski replaces Federico Bernardeschi. { Arthur has hardly been on the pitch that long but he picks up a yellow for a particularly indulgent challenge now. Juventus need to watch their own temper as much as Zenit do. { Zenit make their first change now as Sardar Azmoun replaces Artem Dzyuba. { Zenit make their second change now as Aleksey Sutormin replaces Vyacheslav Karavaev. { Zenit make their third change as Daler Kuzyaev replaces Malcom. { Juventus make their fourth change now as Moise Kean replaces Alvaro Morata, { Juventus make their fifth change now as Aaron Ramsey replaces Rodrigo Bentancur. { He was such a threat in that first half and De Sciglio has got his just reward with that touch. Spare a though for Zenit, very much as big a part of this match in drive and aplomb - but unless they can change something fast, the Juve man's well-lofted delivery is going to be the hilt of the knife against them. { GOAL! DEJAN KULUSEVSKI FOR JUVENTUS IN THE FINAL ACT! 1-0! Zenit's hearts are broken but the Bianconeri will not care! They tip an average set-piece wide to the left flank to find Mattia De Sciglio, who controls his collection and floats it back in - whereupon the substitute glides a fantastic header from the middle to come in off the right edge. { Zenit make their fourth change now as Daniil Krugovoy replaces Dmitriy Chistyakov. { Zenit make their fifth change now as Aleksandr Erokhin replaces Claudinho, moments before Chiesa shades a finish to the left of the goal. { But is there a late twist in the game? Ramsey is deemed to have dragged back Krugovoy on the break and Zenit will have a free-kick while the Juve man is booked. "

Rakitskiy gathers and cuts back on to his right foot to float a cross towards the six-yard box. Kuzyaev rises and directs his header away from Dahlin into the top-left corner. { OFF! Ahmedhodzic is dismissed for deliberate handball after a VAR check. Kuzyaev latches on to a knockdown from Dzyuba and flicks the ball forward. It strikes the hand of Ahmedhodzic, preventing a goal-scoring opportunity for the hosts. The referee brandishes the red card after initially giving the defender a yellow following a consultation with the screen at the side of the pitch. { Rakip is withdrawn for the visitors and is replaced by Olsson.

SUTORMIN CURLS HOME A FINE STRIKE!!! 3-0 ZENIT!!!!! The Russian outfit notch their third goal of the night to surely put the game beyond doubt. Sutormin is afforded space and time to cut inside from the right flank. He opens up room on his left foot to strike a powerful low curling effort that travels away from Dahlin and into the bottom-left corner. Perfect precision from the wing-back. { Kravtsov replaces Sutormin for the closing stages of the contest for the hosts. { Douglas Santos has had a fine outing and is now withdrawn for Krugovoy. { Mostovoy enters the action to replace Dzyuba in the final third. { Brorsson pulls back Malcom on the charge and goes into the book. { Eile makes his way on to the field to replace Brorsson for the visitors. { Birmancevic is withdrawn by Tomasson for the closing stages as Nalic replaces the forward. { GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! WENDEL MAKES IT FOUR!!!! 4-0 ZENIT!!! Wendel wraps up a convincing victory for the hosts with a close-range finish. Azmoun leads a break at the Malmo defence and cuts inside the box from the left flank to shoot on his right foot. Dahlin denies the forward, but Wendel is on the spot to convert the rebound. "
