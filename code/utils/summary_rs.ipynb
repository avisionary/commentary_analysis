       "\" FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 0-2 REAL MADRID   Valverde sweeps a pass out to Ceballos, who cuts inside and shoots straight at Kepa from the edge of the area. That should be that for Madrid, and for Chelsea's Champions League campaign.   Camavinga and Valverde team up to deny Sterling a route to the byline. Though Chelsea missed a couple of clear chances at 0-0, Madrid's backline has stood firm for the majority of this game.   We're into three minutes of stoppage time as Felix shoots well over. Real Madrid's fans are in great voice, their defence of the Champions League trophy is set to continue! For Chelsea, a trophyless campaign is about to become reality.   Mudryk picks up a late booking for a frustrated lunge on Modric in midfield.   Now Mudryk bursts through on goal at the other end and smashes into the side-netting, only for the flag to go up. The Ukrainian mistimed his run, but his wayward finish was typical of Chelsea's efforts in the final third.   Good save, but the flag is up! Vinicius latches onto Asensio's neat pass and forces a one-on-one save from Kepa, only to be flagged offside!   Valverde and Vinicius are enjoying themselves now, capitalising on James' loose pass in midfield to launch a flowing move, which only ends when Silva steps in inside his own area.   Valverde is involved again as he charges to the byline and crosses low, only for Kepa to dive on the ball. The atmosphere is very flat among the home fans now.   Chelsea look to respond through Felix, who sees a shot blocked inside the six-yard box. The Blues have come up short in attack once again here.   Experienced defender Nacho, meanwhile, is on for Carvajal at right-back.   That will be Rodrygo's final involvement, with Ancelotti opting to withdraw the Brazilian and introduce Asensio.   Valverde has been outstanding at Stamford Bridge, and he is credited with the assist after teeing up Rodrygo when he could have gone for goal himself. He showed great composure to beat Silva in the build-up. What a goal!   GOAAAAAAL! RODRYGO GETS HIS BRACE! 2-0! What a goal this is from Madrid! A splendid move sees Vinicius dart onto Rudiger's ball in behind and cut back for Valverde on the edge of the area. The midfielder takes a fine touch past Silva before bearing down on Kepa and unselfishly squaring for Rodrygo to tap in. It's 4-0 on aggregate, and the holders are heading to the Champions League semi-finals!   Mount and Sterling are supporting Felix in the Chelsea attack now, with Mudryk filling in at left wing-back. The Blues have failed to garner any momentum since Rodrygo's goal, and Madrid have actually looked the more likely scorers on the break.   Lampard responds with a change of his own. Mount comes on for Havertz, who has been lively but lacking in end product.   Ancelotti turns to his bench again, withdrawing Kroos for Ceballos in midfield. \""

While Madrid's Champions League defence continues apace, Chelsea have lost four successive matches since Frank Lampard returned to the club as interim boss. The Blues will now endure just their second trophyless season in the last seven campaigns, and with 17 points separating them from the Premier League's top four, it could be some time before Stamford Bridge hosts another Champions League fixture!   It's all over at Stamford Bridge, and it's another 2-0 win over Chelsea for Real Madrid – Los Blancos take the quarter-final tie 4-0 on aggregate! Chelsea performed admirably for long periods as Cucurella and Kante missed great chances to cut Madrid's lead, but they could not find a response when Rodrygo hammered Vinicius' cut-back in from close range after 58 minutes. A flowing move involving Valverde led to Rodrygo getting a second with 10 minutes remaining, and Madrid look like they have plenty more to offer as they approach a semi-final tie against Manchester City or Bayern Munich! \""
