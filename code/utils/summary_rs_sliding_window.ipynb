       "[\"A rare loose ball from Modric gives Chelsea the chance to put Madrid under pressure, but Kante is crowded out near the edge of the area and Madrid survive. Chelsea continue to press as James' cross runs all the way through to Kovacic on the edge of the area, only for Militao to block his shot at close quarters. Chelsea have progressed from five of their last seven Champions League ties when losing the first leg away from home, and they have also qualified from their last two ties when losing the opener by two clear goals (vs Napoli in 2011-12 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2013-14).\",\n",
       " \"Militao's yellow card means he will miss the first leg of any semi-final tie through suspension, if Madrid make it…   Militao appears to be in some discomfort following that challenge on Gallagher, having kicked the bottom of the Chelsea man's boot as he flew in at a dangerous height. Rodrygo finds space on the right-hand side of the area after linking up with Carvajal, and the Brazilian youngster opts to go for goal after shifting the ball to his right foot. The Madrid man is booked as Chelsea get a free-kick in a dangerous position, with Fernandez set to deliver.   \",\n",
       " \"Kovacic dances through midfield and tees up James on the right, allowing him to pick out his opposite wing-back Cucurella with a terrific low cross. So much of Chelsea's attacking play has come down that flank, but wing-back James appeared to be limping a moment ago, which will be a big concern for Lampard.    Havertz flicks the corner on, but Gallagher can't reach the loose ball and it drops harmlessly wide of Courtois' right-hand post.   \",\n",
       " 'Rodrygo is the target of a clever free-kick into the right-hand channel, but Chalobah and Silva combine to crowd the Brazilian out and win possession for Chelsea.    Chelsea are baying for a second yellow card for Militao as the Brazilian clips Chalobah on the left flank! Madrid make a half-time substitution as former Chelsea favourite Rudiger enters the fray.',\n",
       " \"Following his opener in this game, all four of Rodrygo's Champions League knockout-stage goals have come against English sides, with the Brazilian scoring two apiece against Chelsea and Manchester City.    Rodrygo and Vinicius link up on the left-hand side of the area, with the former escaping a challenge to tee up Benzema just six yards out. Gallagher shows good strength to hold off Carvajal and tee up Fernandez, who sees a dipping, left-footed shot parried by Courtois!   \",\n",
       " \" FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 0-2 REAL MADRID   Valverde sweeps a pass out to Ceballos, who cuts inside and shoots straight at Kepa from the edge of the area. Valverde and Vinicius are enjoying themselves now, capitalising on James' loose pass in midfield to launch a flowing move, which only ends when Silva steps in inside his own area.    The Blues have failed to garner any momentum since Rodrygo's goal, and Madrid have actually looked the more likely scorers on the break.   \"]"

       "\"A rare loose ball from Modric gives Chelsea the chance to put Madrid under pressure, but Kante is crowded out near the edge of the area and Madrid survive. Chelsea continue to press as James' cross runs all the way through to Kovacic on the edge of the area, only for Militao to block his shot at close quarters. Chelsea have progressed from five of their last seven Champions League ties when losing the first leg away from home, and they have also qualified from their last two ties when losing the opener by two clear goals (vs Napoli in 2011-12 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2013-14). Militao's yellow card means he will miss the first leg of any semi-final tie through suspension, if Madrid make it…   Militao appears to be in some discomfort following that challenge on Gallagher, having kicked the bottom of the Chelsea man's boot as he flew in at a dangerous height. Rodrygo finds space on the right-hand side of the area after linking up with Carvajal, and the Brazilian youngster opts to go for goal after shifting the ball to his right foot. The Madrid man is booked as Chelsea get a free-kick in a dangerous position, with Fernandez set to deliver.    Kovacic dances through midfield and tees up James on the right, allowing him to pick out his opposite wing-back Cucurella with a terrific low cross. So much of Chelsea's attacking play has come down that flank, but wing-back James appeared to be limping a moment ago, which will be a big concern for Lampard.    Havertz flicks the corner on, but Gallagher can't reach the loose ball and it drops harmlessly wide of Courtois' right-hand post.    Rodrygo is the target of a clever free-kick into the right-hand channel, but Chalobah and Silva combine to crowd the Brazilian out and win possession for Chelsea.    Chelsea are baying for a second yellow card for Militao as the Brazilian clips Chalobah on the left flank! Madrid make a half-time substitution as former Chelsea favourite Rudiger enters the fray. Following his opener in this game, all four of Rodrygo's Champions League knockout-stage goals have come against English sides, with the Brazilian scoring two apiece against Chelsea and Manchester City.    Rodrygo and Vinicius link up on the left-hand side of the area, with the former escaping a challenge to tee up Benzema just six yards out. Gallagher shows good strength to hold off Carvajal and tee up Fernandez, who sees a dipping, left-footed shot parried by Courtois!     FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 0-2 REAL MADRID   Valverde sweeps a pass out to Ceballos, who cuts inside and shoots straight at Kepa from the edge of the area. Valverde and Vinicius are enjoying themselves now, capitalising on James' loose pass in midfield to launch a flowing move, which only ends when Silva steps in inside his own area.    The Blues have failed to garner any momentum since Rodrygo's goal, and Madrid have actually looked the more likely scorers on the break.   \""

Cucurella is on hand to intercept a slack ball from Valverde in midfield, and Chelsea can look to build an attack.

Rodrygo finds space on the right-hand side of the area after linking up with Carvajal, and the Brazilian youngster opts to go for goal after shifting the ball to his right foot. James works some space to hit a low cross into the six-yard box, but Alaba slides in to divert it away from the danger zone! Kovacic dances through midfield and tees up James on the right, allowing him to pick out his opposite wing-back Cucurella with a terrific low cross. Vinicius looks to play a give-and-go with Modric, but the Croatian plays an uncharacteristically poor pass straight to James. Vinicius gets the assist for Rodrygo's goal, staying cool under pressure at the far post to pick out his opposite winger, who makes no mistake from close range!   GOAAAAAAAL! Havertz sees a right-wing cross acrobatically headed away by Rudiger, but Gallagher nods the ball back into the danger zone. Chelsea are furious as Vinicius goes down under minimal pressure from Fofana, with the referee blowing for a free-kick. Chelsea appeal for a penalty as Havertz spins Modric inside the area and goes down. With the Brazilian set to shoot, Mudryk dashes back to make a fine challenge, preventing further damage for the hosts. James sees a low shot from outside the area hit Militao and deflect wide for a corner. A splendid move sees Vinicius dart onto Rudiger's ball in behind and cut back for Valverde on the edge of the area. Though Chelsea missed a couple of clear chances at 0-0, Madrid's backline has stood firm for the majority of this game. Mudryk picks up a late booking for a frustrated lunge on Modric in midfield.\""

       "\" Vinicius tracks back to battle with James, winning a goal-kick for his team. Chelsea are looking to find their right wing-back at every opportunity, and they are causing Madrid problems early on.   Handball! Chalobah steps into midfield and releases Havertz in behind, with the German reaching the byline. He stands up a decent cross towards James, but the referee penalises the Chelsea man as he attempts to control it inside the area.   Chelsea continue to press as James' cross runs all the way through to Kovacic on the edge of the area, only for Militao to block his shot at close quarters. This is a decent spell for the hosts!   WIDE! What a chance for Chelsea! Havertz battles for a cross and the ball drops to Kante 12 yards from goal, completely unmarked. The midfielder swings his left foot at the ball, but he completely scuffs his volley and it bounces wide. That's a real let-off for Madrid!   A rare loose ball from Modric gives Chelsea the chance to put Madrid under pressure, but Kante is crowded out near the edge of the area and Madrid survive. The hosts are at least pressing high when Madrid have possession in their own half, causing the European champions some difficulties.   Chelsea have progressed from five of their last seven Champions League ties when losing the first leg away from home, and they have also qualified from their last two ties when losing the opener by two clear goals (vs Napoli in 2011-12 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2013-14). If they can complete a comeback in this tie, it would surely top those past achievements.   Vinicius gets his first chance to run at Fofana, but the Brazilian overhits his cross after cutting inside and it floats harmlessly behind.   Havertz is playing a lone striking role for Chelsea early on, with Kante and Gallagher pushing higher than Kovacic and Fernandez in midfield. Madrid have lined up in their usual 4-3-3 shape, looking to make the pitch wide and dominate possession.   Kante steals possession from Benzema, but Madrid quickly get it back as Carvajal wins a throw. It's been a fast start here as both teams battle for the ball in midfield.   Cucurella is on hand to intercept a slack ball from Valverde in midfield, and Chelsea can look to build an attack.   Havertz looks to get Chelsea on the front foot straight away, winning a throw-in high on the left. You feel the Blues must score first to have any chance of launching a comeback.   A somewhat bizarre moment before kick-off as the players line up… only for the Champions League anthem to not be played! Stamford Bridge is rocking as Gallagher gets us under way! \""

He's just cut inside and fired a shot towards the near post, but Kepa was equal to it.   Kante is booked for a late challenge on Rodrygo, who was looking to burst into the box.   CHANCE!

       "\" We hope you have enjoyed our live coverage of yet another European win for Real Madrid. It's goodbye for now, and we'll see you next time!   While Madrid's Champions League defence continues apace, Chelsea have lost four successive matches since Frank Lampard returned to the club as interim boss. The Blues will now endure just their second trophyless season in the last seven campaigns, and with 17 points separating them from the Premier League's top four, it could be some time before Stamford Bridge hosts another Champions League fixture!   It's all over at Stamford Bridge, and it's another 2-0 win over Chelsea for Real Madrid – Los Blancos take the quarter-final tie 4-0 on aggregate! Chelsea performed admirably for long periods as Cucurella and Kante missed great chances to cut Madrid's lead, but they could not find a response when Rodrygo hammered Vinicius' cut-back in from close range after 58 minutes. A flowing move involving Valverde led to Rodrygo getting a second with 10 minutes remaining, and Madrid look like they have plenty more to offer as they approach a semi-final tie against Manchester City or Bayern Munich! \""
