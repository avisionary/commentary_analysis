The former Bournemouth man did well to push a low shot away from danger after the striker had dribbled past a couple of defenders. Gundogan found Haaland with a pass across the box, but the goalkeeper denied him again. However, he could do nothing to stop a powerful header from Stones, with the centre-back getting on the end of a free-kick from De Bruyne. ",,,,half time summary,Manchester City,MCI,Arsenal,ARS,4 - 1
